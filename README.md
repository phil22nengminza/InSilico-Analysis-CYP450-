# In-Silico Structural and Functional Analysis of Cytochrome P450 Enzyme in *Aedes aegypti*

This repository contains the computational modeling and active-site prediction of a Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme from *Aedes aegypti*.  
The project integrates sequence retrieval, homology modeling, and ligand-binding site prediction.

## Tools & Databases used
**UniProt** – Protein sequence retrieval  
**SWISS-MODEL** – Homology modeling
**PrankWeb (P2Rank)** – Ligand-binding site prediction
**Mol\*** Viewer – Structural visualization  

##  Summary
The selected Cytochrome P450 model displayed the conserved P450 fold, dominated by α-helices surrounding a central cavity.  
PrankWeb predicted several potential ligand-binding pockets, with **Pocket 1 showing the highest confidence score**, suggesting it to be the primary substrate-binding site.
